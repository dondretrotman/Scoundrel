# Scoundrel
A python implementation of the card game  
Official(?) rules are here: http://www.stfj.net/art/2011/Scoundrel.pdf  
  
This follows all the rules *except*:  
1. No running from rooms
2. It replaces the card immediately instead of waiting until you clear the room

This was just a little excercise to see how fast I could do it (about 6 hours)
